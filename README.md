# Deep Learning - Final Project

Deep Learning project developed in the context of the 
[Deep Learning course](https://mycourses.aalto.fi/course/view.php?id=16963#section-0)
at Aalto University.

The aim of this project is to classify breast histological images in order to
detect the presence and the kind of cancer in them.

This project is also aimed at competing in the 
[ICIAR 2018 Grand Challenge](https://iciar2018-challenge.grand-challenge.org/dataset/).


## Tools

The tools used in this project are the Python interpreter together with the
Tensorflow library.
